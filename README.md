Activist Builder
================

Activist Builder is a web interface to customize builds of the activist
script.

In particualr, activist.js defines both a standard `offline.html` page
which is shown when a direct connection cannot be made, and a warning
that we believe interference is occuring, which is programatically defined
in `render.js`.

This server provides a graphical mechanism to configure these two additions
to your site, along with appropriate path configuration based on the location
of your deployment.
