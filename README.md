activist.js
===========

activist.js is a [freedom.js](http://freedomjs.com) application for loading
content through peers when a server is unavailable.

Activist comes in 2 versions, which offer a trade-off between how much work you
need to do to add the library to your site, and how many of your users will be
able to take advantage of activist.js.  New browsers provide features that make
the installation of activist.js as simple as adding a script tag to your home
page, however this version of the library will only work for a small percentage
of your user base. If you are willing to use activist in addition to an app
cache, it will be able to help a much larger fraction of your user base, but
requires additional changes to your site.
