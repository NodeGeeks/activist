          dt What is Activist.js?
          dd.
            Activist.js is a library which attempts to provide resilience for
            websites without cooperation from visitors, browsers, or the
            network. It does this by caching a script when visitors access your
            server, which will make additional attempts to access content when
            the server cannot be directly reached.
          dt Which browsers does Activist.js support?
          dd.
            Activist.js supports all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox,
            and Internet Explorer. A full matrix of expected behavior is
            maintained on our [wiki](https://github.com/willscott/activist/issues/4).
          dt Why is this a thing?
          dd.
            The mechanisms that Activist.js uses to cache content were designed
            for accessing websites when the user is offline, and are used by
            some large websites, like Google Docs and Wunderlist. Due to their
            design, these mechanisms have been difficult to retrofit onto sites
            which are not designed for them. Activist.js provides a minimally
            invasive drop-in solution for adding an Application Cache fall-back
            to most websites without additional server-side support.
          dt What else can I do?
          dd.
            We are working to create web standards which make it easier to
            accomplish the same goals that are accomplished by Activist.js.
